# phpPgAdmin

## About this project

This project is a fork of [ReimuHakurei/phpPgAdmin](https://github.com/ReimuHakurei/phpPgAdmin).  
The goal is to maintain and actively develop phpPgAdmin, ensuring it stays robust and up to date.  
To achieve this, I plan to gradually rewrite the codebase, following Martin Fowlerâ€™s [Strangler Fig](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html) approach step by step.

I appreciate any form of help or feedback!
